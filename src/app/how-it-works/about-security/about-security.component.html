<h2>Security</h2>
<p>While we have put a lot of effort into the security of this site, internet security is not our profession and we cannot 100% guarantee the integrity of elections conducted on our site. Under no circumstance should an online service be used to conduct an official election due to inherent risks of voter fraud. The purpose of this site is to provide a platform for people to learn about and engage with ranked choice voting in a casual way.</p>
